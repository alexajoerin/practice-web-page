    <p>Hello! I am an ambitious new web developer based in Boulder, CO. I have a background in the audio industry and love hands on creative hobbies like sewing and rug tufting. My passion for learning drives me to try a lot of new things and I love collaborating with people to share knowledge and find new ways of doing things! </p>
    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>My interest in coding started in 2020 while I was still living in Detroit. I knew I wanted to change careers and learn new skills but I had never really considered an interest in the tech field until a friend of mine took a bootcamp herself and could not stop talking about how rewarding it was. Although I wasn't ready to take the leap at that time she encouraged me to try it out as she thought my creative background could really apply to Javascript. I started taking some free coding classes here and there and really enjoyed easing my way in slowly but I still wasn't fully convinced it was the best career option for me.</p>
    <p>Fastforward to 2023, I moved to Colorado and quickly learned it was one of the top states for tech workers. I was a lot more immersed into the culture and started learning just how much you can do in this field. It was beginning to feel a lot more exciting to me and I started taking prep courses for a couple of different coding bootcamps but the layout and the culture just didn't feel like the right fit. In comes Grand Circus. They were the very first bootcamp I had ever taken an intro course with in Michigan and I decided to look them up and see if I could go back to my roots and join a cohort. I was very excited to learn that they were fully remote and accepted out of state students. Talking with admissions, I quickly realized that this bootcamp was a much better fit, vibe and learning culture for me. I have a few friends who can not say enough good things about Grand Circus and it feels awesome to be able to break into the tech field this way.</p>
